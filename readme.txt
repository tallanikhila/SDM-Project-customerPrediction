Supermarket Sales Customer Prediction

Abstract
In order to improve the sales, it is very important how we choose a customer in the future so that he could get all the benefits from a supermarket. We have used different models to predict a set of potential members to give the memberships to enjoy the perks. We have used models like KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree Classifier, and AdaBoost Classifier. This prediction is useful for a store to provide personalized advertisements to the potential members who are eligible.

The models that we are using here are:

1.KNN - K Nearest Neighbors

2. Decision Tree Classifier 

3. Random Forest Classifier 

4.ADABoost Classifier

An accuracy graph is also shown for all the models on the dataset to identify the best model. Different types of visualizations are shown on the dataset.
